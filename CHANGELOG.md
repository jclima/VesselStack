# Changelog

All notable changes to VesselStack are documented here. The project follows
Semantic Versioning.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-08-21

### Privacy

- Replaced reference-vessel names, identifiers, network addresses, paths,
  hardware facts, engine details, AIS examples, and local entity prefixes with
  neutral placeholders.
- Added distribution checks and publishing guidance to reduce the chance of
  committing vessel identity, credentials, or private key material.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-08-21

### Added

- Reproducible Raspberry Pi OS and Debian-family installer with generated
  credentials, pinned multi-architecture images, and systemd confinement.
- Existing, Docker, and native SignalK modes.
- Opt-in, hardware-probed SocketCAN and AIS-catcher modules.
- Configurable InfluxDB schema with idempotent bucket and downsample-task
  provisioning.
- Grafana datasource and system-health dashboard provisioning.
- Generic Home Assistant battery, bilge/high-water, and shore-power alert
  blueprints plus a Lovelace starter view.
- `vesselstackctl` status, start, stop, restart, backup, verified restore,
  guarded update, and uninstall workflows.
- Optional untrusted-interface firewall and explicit 0.1-to-1.0 configuration
  migration.
- Clean-install, migration, recovery, ARM64 manifest, application, packaging,
  and disposable service-integration test gates.

### Safety

- Hardware and firewall modules remain disabled by default.
- Safety automations require explicit entity, threshold, duration, and action
  selection.
- VesselStack remains advisory software and is not certified navigation,
  collision-avoidance, alarm, engine-control, or life-safety equipment.
